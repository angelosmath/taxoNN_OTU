# TaxoNN_OTU

An ensemble learning based method for training Convolutional Neural Networks on OTU data after stratification based on phyla. This is a deep learning methodology to arrange OTU data for CNN modelling based on similarity between OTUs in phylum level of the taxonomy tree.


Three datasets are used: 1) Simulation study 2) T2D study by Qin et al., 2012 and 3) Cirrhosis study by Qin et al., 2014. The files NN_Sim.py, NN_T2D.py and NN_Cirr.py are the main files. Relative abundance in OTUs are present in rows for each individual in the files Sim_OTU.csv, T2D_OTU.csv and Cirr_OTU.csv. 
The datasets are stored in T2D.zip, Cirrhosis.zip and Simulation Data.zip.
